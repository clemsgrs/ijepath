# Package Default Configs Plan

- [x] Add a failing test that asserts default config resources exist under `configs/profiles` and `configs/runs`.
- [x] Rearrange repository configs into `profiles/` and `runs/` subfolders.
- [x] Add packaging metadata so wheel artifacts include default config resources.
- [x] Add a small config-resource helper API for runtime access.
- [x] Update docs/README paths to the new config structure.
- [x] Run targeted tests to prove behavior and packaging assumptions.
