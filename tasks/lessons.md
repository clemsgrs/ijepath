- When discussing packaging of config files, preserve the domain-oriented config taxonomy (`profiles/`, `runs/`) instead of flattening defaults into a single folder.
- When proposing wheel data layout, prefer mirrored on-disk structure so repo usage and installed-package usage stay aligned.
- When the user specifies a project virtualenv interpreter, use that exact interpreter for all verification and packaging commands.
